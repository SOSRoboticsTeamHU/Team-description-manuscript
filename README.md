Our team, consisting of three software development and testing students from NYSZC Széchenyi István Technikum és Kollégium, is participating in the RMRC competition for the first time. We share a passion for programming, robotics, 3D modeling, and problem-solving, which has driven us to design and build an autonomous robot capable of QR code scanning, object manipulation, and multi-directional movement. Throughout this project, we have gained extensive technical knowledge, making this experience both challenging and rewarding.
Our robot's structure prioritizes efficiency and adaptability. The plexiglass frame ensures durability while keeping the weight minimal. 12V DC motors provide precise movement, while a ProXtend X701 4K camera handles QR code recognition. The power system relies on a rechargeable ParkSide battery, with custom 3D-printed motor mounts and a battery connector for optimized assembly. The robot is controlled via a wired laptop connection, ensuring stable communication and responsiveness.
The robotic arm, constructed with metal brackets, enables reliable object manipulation. Its movement is powered by servo motors, allowing for controlled and accurate positioning.
On the software side, our Python-based system runs on a Raspberry Pi, integrating libraries such as RPi.GPIO for motor control, OpenCV for image processing. A multi-threaded approach ensures simultaneous processing of sensor inputs, movement control, and task execution, improving efficiency and real-time responsiveness.
This project has been an exciting challenge for our team. Despite the difficulties we encountered, we have gained valuable experience in hardware integration, software development, and teamwork. Our goal was to create a reliable and adaptable robot, and we take great pride in what we have accomplished. This competition is not just a test of our technical skills but also an opportunity to grow, innovate, and take a step forward in the world of robotics.
